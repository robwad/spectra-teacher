# Spectra Teacher

This is a browser web app myself and two classmates completed in CS 179 @ Harvard: Design of Useful and Usable Interactive Systems. The emphasis of the class was on user testing and design, rather than web development. I've included some of the relevant files in the Design folder.

The purpose of this web app is to enable teachers to easily assess the mental state of their students and incident history, allowing for personalized interactions and informed intervention.
The app works alongside the companion Spectra Student mobile web app that enables middle school students to record information about their mood and frame of mind each day.
